Parallel Programming aimed at developing parallel applications using an adequate programming model and to evaluate the application performance.

* Develop C/C+ programs

* Identify difficulties related to parallel programming

* Apply an adequate methodology for the development of parallel applications

* Understand the differences of parallel programming approaches: Shared memory, message passing

* Determine the most convinient parallel programming approach to develop a particular application

* Develop parallel applications

* Evaluate parallel application performance and collect necessary measurements to tune the application in order to improve its performance
